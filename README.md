# Is It Scott?
A Jackbox-style party game I made for my wife's bachelorette party

### Gameplay
- Round will consist of a random groomsman's body part--you have to guess who it belongs to
    - Example: Photo could be of Dustin's knee
- 54 rounds (9 photos x 6 people)
- Some rounds worth double and triple points

### Point System
If the answer is Scott:
- Correct guess = 2 pt
- Incorrect guess = 0 pt

If the answer is one of the groomsmen:
- Correct guess = 2 pt
- Partially correct guess = 1 pt (guess a groomsmen but not the right one)
- Incorrect guess = 0 pt
